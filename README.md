# Live Coding & Algorithms from Interviews

This repository contains a collection of tasks I was asked during interviews for QA Automation positions. These include live coding challenges, refactoring exercises, and algorithmic problems.

## About This Repository

- No names of companies or interviewers are included
- Tasks are implemented in various languages:
  - Go

Feel free to explore! Keep in mind that this is more of a personal playground than a polished or well-organized project.
